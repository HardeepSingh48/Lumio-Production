## 📁 Project Structure (high-level)

```
Lumio-Saas/
├─ app/              # App Router entrypoints, routes, layouts, pages
│  ├─ page.tsx       # Landing / root page (edit & save to auto‑refresh)
│  └─ ...
├─ public/           # Static assets served as-is
├─ styles/           # Global styles (if used)
├─ package.json      # Scripts & dependencies
└─ README.md         # You are here
```

> **Tip:** Your primary development work will often begin in `app/page.tsx`. The dev server supports hot reloading.

---

## 🚧 Getting Started

Clone & install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HardeepSingh48/Lumio-Saas.git
cd Lumio-Saas

# install packages
npm install        # or: yarn install | pnpm install | bun install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open your browser to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Start building by editing **`app/page.tsx`** — the page updates automatically on save.

---

## 🧪 Environment Variables (optional)

If your SaaS project requires API keys or runtime config, create a `.env.local` file at the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local  # if an example file exists
```

Then define variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://api.example.com"
SECRET_KEY="replace_me"
```

Restart the dev server after changes.

---

## 🏗 Build & Run in Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server locally (after building):

```bash
npm start
```

By default this will serve the compiled app on `http://localhost:3000` unless overridden.

---
